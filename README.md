# GM-_OBD_2PIDs
A CSV list of OBD2 PIDs that have been tested and work with a 3rd Gen 2001 Chevy Cavalier 2.2L for Torque Pro and others.

This list contains data gathered from the internet and has been tested to work on a 2001 Chevy Cavalier 2.2L Automatic Transmission.
Most of this original list is from gmtnation.com and their amazing work gathering this information. The ones from GMTN will have a ` before the name.
This list is more about showing which ones work and which don't for the 3rd gen (and probably more) 2.2L GM cars.

I have more to add that I have discovered on my own, but I am still testing them and working out the equations. (which takes me a long time)
Feel free to add your own or let me know if I've made a mistake. 
This list will work with the Torque Pro Android app and others that accept csv files.

Install
Copy the file to your Android device you have Torque Pro installed on.
Open Torque Pro and go to settings>Amnage extra PIDs/Sensors
Tap on the menu and choose Import CSV file.
Browse and select the 2001_Cavalier.csv file you copied to your device.
Close settings and the new PIDs will show up when you add, or edit your gauges.
